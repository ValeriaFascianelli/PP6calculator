This is a pp6calculator, a program built up during the c++ lectures.
pp6calculator contains exercises and homework required during lectures. 
The user can choose which operation to perform from different lecture-day menu.
To build the code, go to the pp6calculator.build directory and do the command "make".
After that it is possible to run the program. 
The program will show you different menus:

PP6DAY1MENU: from here you can choose simple basic operation as:
             - Basic operation;
             - Calculate the intercept of a line;
             - Solve a quadratic equation;
             - Calculate the length of 3D vector;
             - Calculate the length of 4D vector;
             - Calculate the invariant mass of two particle;
             - Swap two numbers;
             - Swap an array of numbers. 

PP6DAY2MENU: from here you can choose:
             - Evaluate the main value with its standard deviation of random numbers;
             - Read the observed_particles.dat file and output the 10 largest invariant mass between mu+ and mu-.

PP6DAY3MENU: from here you can choose:
             - Compute the interval of a 4-vector;
             - Compute a Lorentz boost along z axis;
             - Read the observed_particles.dat file and output the 10 largest invariant mass between mu+ and mu-
               using new implemented classes.

PP6DAY4MENU: from here you can choose:
             - Read the pdg.dat file and write on the screen all the information stored on it;
             - Create a database through pdg.dat file in order to retrieve particle information through the particle name;
             - Sorter an array holding random numbers;
             - Read the observed_particles.dat file and output the sorted invariant mass between mu+ and mu-
               using new implemented classes, vector and algorithms.
